Before extracting the DNA, we have to homogenize our sample in a lysis buffer. The mechanical and chemical actions will help cellular lysis and the release of DNA into the solution. In this way, we can the isolate DNA from the other parts of our sample, and purify it for downstream processing.

# Materials

| Name                             | Producer         | Cat. no.  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Lysis buffer                     | See recipe below |           |
| Stainless steel beads (2.4 mm ⌀) | VWR              | 10032-370 |

<br/>

# Protocol

1. Transfer about 50mg of your sample to a 2ml tube.
2. Add 3-5 stainless steel beads.
3. Add 300µl of Lysis buffer.
4. Load samples into the Qiagen TissueLyzer homogenizer. Remember to balance the two arms of the homogenizer. Watch the video below before running the machine.
5. Mill at max frequency (30) for 5 minutes.
6. Invert the plates (see video below) and mill again at max frequency (30) for 5 minutes.
7. Centrifuge at max speed for 30 seconds.
