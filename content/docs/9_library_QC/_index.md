### Agilent Bioanalyzer

You will use the bioanalyzer to check the distribution of the fragments in your library. Think at it as a very precise gel electrophoresis. You will use a **Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit** (cat. no 5067-4626), which is ideal for samples with fragments between 50-2000bp. You will need to provide the output (trace) to the sequencing facility.

Before starting you need to prepare the Gel-Dye mix. This mix is sufficiet for 5 chips and it should be used within 6 weeks from preparation.

{{% alert note%}} Keep the **DNA Dye concentrate** (blue-capped ðŸ”µ vial) in the dark as much as possible. You can keep it inside the box and take it just when needed. {{% /alert %}}

##### Gel-Dye mix

1. Take the reagent box from the fridge (4Â°C) and leave it at room temperature for about 30 minutes.
2. Vortex the blue-capped ðŸ”µ vial with the **DNA Dye concentrate** for 10 seconds, then spin it down with a centrifuge.
3. Pipette 15Âµl of the **DNA Dye concentrate** (blue ðŸ”µ) into the vial with the **DNA gel matrix** (red ðŸ”´)
4. Vortex for 10 seconds. Check if gel and dye are properly mixed by visual inspection.
5. Pipette all the gel-dye mix into one of the vials provided with the kit. These vials have a spin filter on their top. Pipette the gel-dye mix directly inside this filter.
6. Centrifuge the filter (do not forget to balance with another tube of similar weight) for 10 minutes at 2300 rcf.
7. Discard the filter, label the tube with the date, and you are ready to go.

##### Loading the HS chip

Take the reagent box from the fridge (4Â°C) and leave it at room temperature for about 30 minutes.

For accurate instruction on how to load the chip, please consult the {{% staticref "files/ABA_HS_quickguide.pdf" "newtab" %}}last page of the quick guide{{% /staticref %}}, pp- 14-16 of the {{% staticref "files/ABA_HS_full.pdf" "newtab" %}}full guide{{% /staticref %}}, and watch the video below.

### Qubit

You will need to provide a Qubit reading of the final pool to the sequencing facility. See Library pooling section above for instructions on how to do it.
