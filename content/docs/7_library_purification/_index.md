# Protocol

1. Add 0.9X of SPRI beads solution to the total volume (e.g. if you have 50µl of PCR product, add 45µl of SPRI beads)
2. Pipette each sample up and down for 10 times to mix it thorougly.
3. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
4. Put tubes/plate on magnet for 3 minutes.
5. While on magnet, pipette all the content of the tube (do not touch the beads that are now collected on the side of the tube) and discard it.
6. Keeping the tubes/plate on the magnet, add 100µl of 70% Ethanol
7. Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.
8. While on magnet, pipette all the content of the tube (do not touch the beads that are now collected on the side of the tube) and discard it.
9. Keeping the tubes/plate on the magnet, add 100µl of 70% Ethanol
10. Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.
11. While on magnet, pipette all the content of the tube (do not touch the beads that are now collected on the side of the tube) and discard it.
12. Incubate at room temperature for 3 minutes.
13. Add 40µl of ultrapure water.
14. Close the tubes/plate with lids or foil.
15. Vortex the tubes/plate for 20-30 seconds.
16. Briefly centrifuge the tubes/plate (2-3 seconds).
17. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
18. Put tubes/plate on magnet for 3 minutes.
19. Pipette 35µl from the tubes, and put it into a new tube.
