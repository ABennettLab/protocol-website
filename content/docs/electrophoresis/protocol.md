1. **Weight the agarose**. For our purposes we will perform gel electrophoresis using a 1% agarose gel. Thus, the amount of agarose depends on the volume of the elecrophoretic chamber. The one in the tutorial video is a 100ml chamber, thus you need to weight 1g of agarose. For our application we do not have to be extra precise in this weighting, as we just need to asses the presence of the amplicon and roughly its size, while other application require extra care.

2. **Prepare the 1X TAE**. If you are starting with the 25X TAE, aliquot 40ml of starting solution and dilute to 1000ml with deionized water. If you are starting with the 50X TAE, aliquot 20ml of starting solution and dilute to 1000ml with deionized water. In the video tutorial the procedure is shown with a 25X TAE solution prepared from the vendor, in the reagents section you can find the protocol to make a 50X TAE from scratch.

3. **Aliquot the 1X TAE**. The amount depends on the size of the electrophoretic chamber. The one in the tutorial video is a 100ml chamber, thus you need to aliquot 100ml of 1X TAE.

4. **Prepare the agarose gel**. Mix the agarose with the the 1X TAE. Gently swirl it and microwave for about 2 minutes. After microwaving, the solution should look completely clear with no particles floating. 

5. **Add DNA gel stain**. Adding the DNA gel stain will help us to visualize the DNA fragments under UV light. Here we'll use SYBR SAFE. The SYBR SAFE solution is concentrated 10,000X, thus for a 100ml electrophorectic chamber (as in the example) we need to mix 10µl of SYBR SAFE into the heated agarose/TAE mix.

6. **Pour the agarose mix into the electrophoretic chamber**. Make sure there are no bubbles between the combs.

7. **Wait** at least **15 min** to allow the gel to solidify.

8. **Fill the electrophoretic chamber with 1X TAE**. Buffer has to cover the top surface of the gel.

9. **Mix samples with loading dye**. Before samples can be loaded into the agarose gel, we need to mix them with the loading dye. This is a coloured solution that helps us to keep track of the wells we are loading, and helps the DNA to fall at the bottom of the well and to not float in the TAE buffer. For each sample we will aliquot 2µl of loading dye onto a piece of parafilm and mix it with 5µl of sample as shown in the video tutorial.

10. **Load the samples into the gel**. See video tutorial for procedure.

11. **Run the gel**. Connect the electrophoretic chamber to the power supply, make sure to have the black electrode far from you and the red one close to you, as shown in the video. Make also sure that the top of the agarose gel is directed towards the black electrode. Set the power supply to 100 V, and run it for 40-50 minutes.

12. **Visualize the gel under UV lights**.
