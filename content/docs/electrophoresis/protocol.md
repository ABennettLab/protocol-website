1. **Weight the agarose**. For our purposes we will perform gel electrophoresis using a 1% agarose gel. Thus, the amount of agarose depends on the volume of the elecrophoretic chamber. The one in the tutorial video is a 100ml chamber, thus you need to weight 1g of agarose. To calculate the amount of agarose simbply multiply the volume of the electrophoretic chamber in ml by 0.01. For our application we do not have to be extra precise in this weighting, as we just need to asses the presence of the amplicon and roughly its size, while other application require extra care.

2. **Prepare the 1X TAE**. If you are starting with the 25X TAE, aliquot 40ml of starting solution and dilute to 1000ml with deionized water. If you are starting with the 50X TAE, aliquot 20ml of starting solution and dilute to 1000ml with deionized water. In the video tutorial the procedure is shown with a 25X TAE solution prepared from the vendor, in the reagents section you can find the protocol to make a 50X TAE from scratch.

3. **Aliquot the 1X TAE**. The amount depends on the size of the electrophoretic chamber. The one in the tutorial video is a 100ml chamber, thus you need to aliquot 100ml of 1X TAE.

4. **Prepare the agarose gel**. Mix the agarose with the the 1X TAE. Gently swirl it and microwave for about 2 minutes. After microwaving, the solution should look completely clear with no particles floating. 

5. **Add DNA gel stain**. Adding the DNA gel stain will help us to visualize the DNA fragments
