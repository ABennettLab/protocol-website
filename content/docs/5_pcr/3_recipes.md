## Dilute primers

### Stock solution (100 µM)

Primers are shipped lyophilized. To prepare the stock solution follow these steps:

1. Centrifuge tubes (few seconds)
2. On the tube locate the number of nmoles (e.g. nmol = 34.5)
3. Multiply the number of nmoles by 10 (e.g. 34.5 nmol x 10 = 345)
4. The result represent the µl of water to add to obtain the stock solution (i.e. 345 µl)
5. After you add water, vortex the vial really well.
6. Prepare working solutions or store at -20 C



### Working solution (10 µM)

Dilute 1:10 the stock solution (e.g. 10µl of stock solution + 90 µl of water).
Store at -20 C
