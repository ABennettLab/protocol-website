It is important to plan in advance which DNA extraction method you will use for your project. Below you can have a look at two different protocols. The first one uses organic solvents to isolate DNA, the second one uses microscopic magnetic beads. The choice depends mainly from the matrix you are going to work with (e.g. soil, water, plant, blood). Another option is to use commercial kits like [QIAGEN DNeasy Plant Mini Kit](https://www.qiagen.com/ca/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-plant-mini-kit/#orderinginformationhttps://www.qiagen.com/ca/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-plant-mini-kit/#orderinginformation) or [QIAGEN DNeasy PowerSoil Kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/dneasy-powersoil-kit/#orderinginformation).
