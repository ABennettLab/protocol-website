# Protocol

{{% alert warning %}}
**BE CAREFUL!!!** <br/>
With this protocol you are going to use very dangerous chemicals, so please consult the lab technician before starting. <br/>
Here some instructions to keep in mind:
1. Wear lab coat and gloves **all the time**. Change gloves frequently if necessary.

2. **Always work under the fume hood**, try to keep the sash as closed as possible.

3. Discard tubes and tips accordingly with the University rules.

4. Amounts for steps 1-4 are calculated for 2ml tubes. Please, be careful if you are using tubes with a different volume.

Before beginning:
- turn on the centrifuge, check that it is empty and that the temperature is set at 4°C. Then, push the button "Fast Temp" or "FT".
- collect some ice in a styrophoam box
- put a falcon tube with 100% ethanol in the freezer
- put a falcon tube with 70% ethanol in the freezer

1. Add 500µl of phenol solution to your sample.

2. Vortex for 5 seconds.

3. Keep samples under the fume hood for 5 minutes.

4. Add 500µl of chloroform.

5. Vortex for 5 seconds.

6. Keep samples under the fume hood for 5 minutes.

7. Centrifuge at 10,000 rcf for 15 minutes at 4°C.[^1]

8. After centrifugation you'll notice that the mix inside the tube divided into three layers. The bottom layer contains all the organic solvents, proteins and stuff we do not want. The thin layer in the middle is full of proteins, and we do not want it as well. The top layer is the one with DNA, and this is the one we're going to extract and transfer it into a new clean tube. Usually this layer is about 20-40% of the total volume, so set the pipette at 300µl, and collect most of the top layer into a clean vial. Remember: it is better to leave a bit of DNA behind than carrying proteins or solvents into the next steps. So, if you do not collect all the top layer it is fine. Discard the old vial.

9. To the supernatant pipetted into the new vial, add 2.5X cold 100% ethanol. For example, if you extracted 300µl of supernatant, you need to add 750µl of ethanol. This doesn't have to be exact, so feel confident to estimate an average amount for all your samples.

10. To the supernatant pipetted into the new vial, add 0.1X sodium acetate 0.3M. For example, if you extracted 300µl of supernatant, you need to add 30µl of sodium acetate. This doesn't have to be exact, so feel confident to estimate an average amount for all your samples.

11. Mix gently by inverting the tube 5-10 times.

12. Incubate samples at -20°C for 30-40 minutes. [^2]

13. Centrifuge at 10,000 rcf for 30 minutes at 4°C. When you remove the tubes from the centrifuge, you'll likely notice a tiny pellett at their bottom. That is the DNA. If you do not notice any pellett, it is fine, maybe it is not enough to be seen by naked eye.

14. Discard the supernatant by inverting the tubes inside a glass beaker.

15. Add 500µl of cold 70% ethanol. [^3]

16. Mix gently by inverting the tube 5-10 times.

17. Centrifuge at 10,000 rcf for 15 minutes at 4°C.

18. Discard the supernatant by inverting the tubes inside a glass beaker.

19. Repeat steps 15-18 another time (total of 2 washes)

20. It is important that we remove all the ethanol. So, open all the vials, cover them with paper towel and leave the rack under the fume hood for 20-30 minutes. You can also leave them overnight. If you have access to a concentrator (e.g. Eppendorf Vacufuge), this will help to speed up the process.

21. Add 100µl of ultrapure water to your sample to dissolve the DNA pellet by vortexing.[^4]

22. Store your samples at -20°C before further analyses. You can also measure DNA concentration before storing your sample.

      

[^1]: If during QC you notice that samples are not clean enough, you might consider to extend this step to 30 minutes
[^2]: If you experience low yields you might consider to extend this incubation time from 1 hour up to overnight. If you have salt co-precipitation issues, you can incubate your samples on ice instead that -20°C.
[^3]: Ethanol 70% is hygroscopic. Consider preparing it fresh for each extraction.
[^4]:  If your DNA yield is low, consider to reduce this amount to 50µl. If you have troubles in dissolving your DNA pellett, try to incubate it at 60°C for 5 minutes.
